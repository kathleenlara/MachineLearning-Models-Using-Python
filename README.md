# Machine Learning Models

This data modeling project is for Apprentice Chef - an innovative startup.

## Business Problem:
Understand how much revenue to expect from each customer within their first year of using their services.

## Solving the Problem:
I explored the dataset and did some feature engineering to help me with my regression analysis. I tried different models to predict what variables are correlated to the REVENUE and can give me a better prediction of what to expect from each customer.

## Overview of the Dataset:
I've uploaded a file named Apprentice Chef Dictionary
